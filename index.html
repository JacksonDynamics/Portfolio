      <h3>A background on me</h3>
    
      <div class="display">
        <p>I am an alumni from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor's degree in Architecture.  After graduation, I decided 
        to change career paths and focused my attention to obtaining my Series 7, 63, & 66 financial licenses while working for Fidelity investments 
        for 9 years. Computers have always fascinated me however, so once again I am shifting my professional interests
        towards the world of Computer Programming.  What better way to do this than by enrolling into the Thinkful 
        Immersive Engineering program!</p>
